### Software to edit and customise the HTML file

> First & foremost, `Download & Install` either [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) editor before proceeding. These are editors with syntax highlighting abilities to make your code editing life easier.

### Important Do (s) & Don't (s)

Before proceeding to editing the code. There are some portions of code that can be freely customised and some that **should never be remove or edited**, below are some instructions to note.

> Codes labeled within `START - DO NOT EDIT CONTENT - START` & `END - DO NOT EDIT CONTENT - END` - **should never be edited**.

> Codes labeled within `START - EDIT CONTENT FREELY - START` & `END - EDIT CONTENT FREELY - END` - can be edited freely.

> Tags that looks like `#XXXXXX` are hexa color codes and ***can be edited freely within the entire code to your liking*** - e.g. by changing a code from `#FFFFFF` to `#DE6C9E` will result in the affected element to become light pink.
